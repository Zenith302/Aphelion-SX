# Aphelion SX
The Aphelion SX is an 8-bit fantasy microcomputer running a 4MHz 65C02, inspired by the Atari XL home computer series :3

A big personal goal for this is to create my own computer based off what I feel like Atari could have (and definitely should have) done to make a proper successor to the original 800/400. This project is also because I want some kind of tangible(-ish) real world thing I can have associated with my fictional company Aphelion Entertainment from the alternate universe stuff my friends and I have been writing. The Aphelion SX is what happens when we thought of the question: "What if we made the XL computers but cooler?" And it's a fun way to learn fantasy computer shit so yay!!!!

This project has no affiliation nor involvement with Atari or any official entity working with/for Atari. I'm simply doing this for myself and my friends, and for fun. There is no infringement intended whatsoever on Atari's anything. Also has no affiliation nor involvement with with Orbit Systems' Aphelion architecture, which is a cool project that I only learned exists after I started this repo and shared my idea around. I don't intend for this to infringe on their architecture or their other works in the slightest either.
