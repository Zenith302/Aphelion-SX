# Aphelion SX
The Aphelion SX is an 8-bit fantasy microcomputer inspired by the Atari XL home computer series :3

A big personal goal for this is to create my own computer based off what I feel like Atari could have (and definitely should have) done to make a proper successor to the original 800/400.

This project has no affiliation nor involvement with Atari or any official entity working with/for Atari. I'm simply doing this for myself and my friends, and for fun. There is no infringement intended whatsoever on Atari's anything.
