# Aphelion SX

Aphelion SX is a line of 8-bit fantasy microcomputers built around a 4MHz 65C02, inspired mainly by the Atari XL home computer series but as well as other 8-bit home computers of the 80's. It is owned by my fictional company Aphelion, which exists in an alternate universe my friends and I have been writing.

A big personal goal for this is to create my own computer based off what I feel like Atari could have (and definitely should have) done to make a proper successor to the original 800/400 by continuing to push the boundaries of computing.

This project is also because I want some kind of tangible(-ish) real world thing I can have associated with my fictional company Aphelion Entertainment from the alternate universe stuff my friends and I have been writing. The Aphelion SX is what came up when we thought of the question: "What if we made the XL computers but cooler?" And it's a fun way to learn fantasy computer shit so yay!!!!

This probably isn't compatible with any Atari 8-bit computers because everything aside from the 65C02 is my own custom silly shit.

Oh yeah also because the design choices of the Commander X16 confuse and somewhat terrify me


# Disclaimers
This project has no affiliation nor involvement with Atari or any official entity working with/for Atari. I don't intend to infringe on anything Atari has made or done.

The Aphelion SX also has no affiliation nor involvement with with Orbit Systems' Aphelion architecture, which is a cool project that I only learned exists after I started this repo and shared my idea around. I don't intend for this to infringe on their architecture or their other works in the slightest either.

I'm simply doing this for myself, my friends, and for fun. There is no infringement intended whatsoever on anybody's anything.
